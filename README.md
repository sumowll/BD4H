How to contribute
================

Create a new branch from develop

    git checkout -b task-xxx develop

If you are working on a task, a issue. You could name the new branch with issue or task number, i.e. _task-2_ or _issue-2_.

Work on your branch and push back to bitbucket after you finish

    git push --set-upstream-to origin task-xxx

When you finish the task/issue, create a [pull request](https://bitbucket.org/realsunlab/bigdata-bootcamp/pull-requests) from your `task-xxx` branch to `develop` branch.
