Deep learning techniques are widely used in many domains such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, and so forth with their great performances. Deep learning techniques have been applied for healthcare applications also and have achieved successes <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>, even though there are some challenges different from other areas. 

Throughout the series of lab sessions, we will introduce some deep learning approches, a varity of neural networks, and practices with healthcare data examples. Enjoy!
